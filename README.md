# Poisson-Distributions-Truncation
In this code, we are exploring Poisson distributions with and without truncation using Python. We will generate random data points from Poisson distributions and fit Poisson probability mass functions to the data. Truncation involves setting values less than 1 to 1 in order to investigate the effects of truncation on the distribution.
